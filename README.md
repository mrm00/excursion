# excursion
Excusrion web - codecademy project! I am experimenting with initializing a repo with a README and then pulling the change to my local repository and then hopefully it works. Also general git bash stuff...
IMPORTANT- when the git bash opens up a separate window and prompts to add a message or something... this is an EMACS window (I think, maybe VIM)
but to save press ESC and then :wq --> look up more on this emacs and git bash stuff!
It worked! The problem I was having before was that I was trying to push my files to a remote repository with a README already there... this caused
an error. What I need to do is first PULL the master from the remote repository to my local repository, this syncs up my local repository to the
remote one. AFTER I can then push all changes to the remote repository with no problem!
